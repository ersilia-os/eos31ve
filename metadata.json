    "Title": "Human Liver Microsomal Stability",
    "Description": "Prediction of human liver microsomal stability is key for the screening of drugs in the early stage of drug discovery. The liver is the main organ for metabolizing drugs in humans and testing its metabolic stability is essential for the early detection of viable drug compounds.",

    "Input Shape": "Single",
    "Output": ["Probability"],
    "Output Type": ["Float"],
    "Output Shape": "Single",
    "Interpretation": "It is a model which provides predicts class (1 or 0) for a given compound. If the predicted class is '1', it means the compound is predicted as unstable (t1/2 <= 30 min) and if the predicted class is '0', the compound is predicted as stable (t1/2 > 30 min). The model also provides a probability score (between 0 and 1), shown in parentheses next to the predicted class.",

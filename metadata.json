    "Description": "The Human Liver Microsomal assay takes into account the liver-mediated drug metabolism to assess the stability of a compound in the human body. The NIH-NCATS group took a proprietary dataset of 4300 compounds with its associated HLM (in vitro half-life; unstable \u2264\u2009 30 min, stable >30 min) and used it to train a classifier.",
